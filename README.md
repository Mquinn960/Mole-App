# Whack A Mole!

This is a small college project which constitutes my first program made in Java early into my self-taught development learning journey. The program features a high score database, adaptive difficulty, scalable UI and bespoke artwork. The program should run without much trouble, however you may need to play about with it a bit and it's archived here to help anyone looking to emulate the same sort of project but please take the code with a large pinch of salt as it does not represent best practices for Android development or OOP in general.
